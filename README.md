# Supply Chain Standards Library

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

## Introduction

The purpose of developing this _"Standardized Supply Chain Library"_ is to
integrate globally recognized standards into the Cardano blockchain. This was
influenced not only by our commitment to fostering robust standards for supply
chain management but also by our strategic aim to directly align these standards
with defined project milestones.

Specifically, we focus on enhancing traceability for 
* [agricultural products](#agricultural-products)
* [optimizing transportation and logistics](#transportation-and-logistics)
* and [retail and consumer goods standards](#retail-and-consumer-goods)

This will be done through the integration of **GS1** standards. GS1 is a
global non-profit organization that develops and maintains standards for
business communication, most notably the standards for barcodes used in retail
supply chains. These standards were selected for their global usability,
interoperability, and ability to promote transparent and efficient operations
across the supply chain.

## Chosen Standards

### Agricultural Products

#### Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)

Central to our traceability initiatives, **GTIN** facilitates the global
identification of agricultural products. This allows for inventory management,
recall execution, and overall product traceability across **agricultural supply
chains**, enabling stakeholders to trace product history from origin to consumer

### Transportation and Logistics

#### Global Location Number (GLN)

**GLN** is pivotal in optimizing **transportation and logistics** by identifying
physical locations and legal entities. This standard aids in streamlining
logistics operations and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, thereby
improving the efficiency and transparency of transportation networks.

### Retail and Consumer Goods

#### Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI)

For **retail and consumer goods**, **GIAI** supports the management of assets
beyond product tracking. It allows for the ability to track individual assets,
facilitating improved supply chain utilization, and overall asset management
within retail environments.

## Complementary Standards

Following the above standards we feel it is imperative to create a foundation to
allow developers to create products and facilitate a way for forward-thinking
and future development. To build on these foundational standards, we employ the
following **GS1** standards within our focus areas:

#### GS1 Global Traceability Standard (GTS)

Provides a structured framework that complements GTIN by ensuring end-to-end
traceability of **agricultural products** from origin to the consumer, enhancing
safety, regulatory compliance, and consumer trust.

#### GS1's EPC Tag Data Standard (TDS)

Utilizes RAIN RFID technology in conjunction with the GLN to enhance the capture
of item-level information, thereby improving inventory management and global
product tracking within transportation and logistics.

## Rationale for Integration

The strategic integration of GS1 standards into the Cardano blockchain is guided
by several critical factors:

### Global Recognition and Adoption

By choosing standards that are widely recognized and adopted globally, we ensure
that applications developed on the Cardano blockchain are compatible with
existing supply chain systems worldwide. This compatibility is essential for
seamless interaction and integration with global supply chain operations, from
agricultural traceability to retail and consumer goods management.

### Increased Traceability and Efficiency

GS1 standards like GTIN and GTS provide robust standards for traceability and
efficiency. For agricultural products, this means being able to track the
journey of products from farm to table, ensuring safety and compliance at every
step. In transportation and logistics, the use of GLN and TDS enables more
efficient and transparent processes, improving logistics operations and delivery
accuracy.

### Regulatory Compliance and Consumer Trust

Implementing these standards not only supports compliance with various
regulatory requirements but also builds consumer trust by enabling transparent
and verifiable supply chain practices. In retail environments, the use of GIAI
for asset management ensures that consumer goods meet the highest standards of
quality and safety.
