[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

## Introduction

The purpose of developing this _"Standardized Supply Chain Library"_ is to
integrate globally recognized standards into the Cardano blockchain. This was
influenced not only by our commitment to fostering robust standards for supply
chain management but also by our strategic aim to directly align these standards
with defined project milestones.

Specifically, we focus on enhancing traceability for

* [agricultural products](#agricultural-products)
* [optimizing transportation and logistics](#transportation-and-logistics)
* and [retail and consumer goods standards](#retail-and-consumer-goods)

This will be done through the integration of **GS1** standards. GS1 is a
global non-profit organization that develops and maintains standards for
business communication, most notably the standards for barcodes used in retail
supply chains. These standards were selected for their global usability,
interoperability, and ability to promote transparent and efficient operations
across the supply chain.

## Chosen Standards

The GS1 General Specifications Standard forms the backbone of our efforts,
providing the framework for the unique and universal identification of products,
services, and entities across various supply chains. Here's how each component
specifically supports our targeted milestones:

### Agricultural Products

#### Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)

Central to our traceability initiatives, **GTIN** facilitates the global
identification of agricultural products. This allows for inventory management,
recall execution, and overall product traceability across **agricultural supply
chains**, enabling stakeholders to trace product history from origin to consumer

### Transportation and Logistics

#### Global Location Number (GLN)

**GLN** is pivotal in optimizing **transportation and logistics** by identifying
physical locations and legal entities. This standard aids in streamlining
logistics operations and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, thereby
improving the efficiency and transparency of transportation networks.

### Retail and Consumer Goods

#### Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI)

For **retail and consumer goods**, **GIAI** supports the management of assets
beyond product tracking. It allows for the ability to track individual assets,
facilitating improved supply chain utilization, and overall asset management
within retail environments.

## Complementary Standards

Following the above standards we feel it is imperative to create a foundation to
allow developers to create products and facilitate a way for forward-thinking
and future development. To build on these foundational standards, we employ the
following **GS1** standards within our focus areas:

#### GS1 Global Traceability Standard (GTS)

Provides a structured framework that complements GTIN by ensuring end-to-end
traceability of **agricultural products** from origin to the consumer, enhancing
safety, regulatory compliance, and consumer trust.

#### GS1's EPC Tag Data Standard (TDS)

Utilizes RAIN RFID technology in conjunction with the GLN to enhance the capture
of item-level information, thereby improving inventory management and global
product tracking within transportation and logistics.

## Potential Outcomes

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Traceability and Transparency**: The adoption of GS1 standards,
   such as GTIN and GLN, will significantly improve the traceability and
   transparency of products through the Cardano blockchain. This could lead to
   better inventory management, more efficient recall processes, and enhanced
   consumer safety.
2. **Global Compatibility and Interoperability**: By integrating globally
   recognized standards, applications built on the Cardano blockchain will be
   compatible with existing international supply chain systems. This
   interoperability is crucial for ensuring that the Cardano blockchain can
   interact seamlessly with global partners, thereby increasing its adoption and
   utility.
3. **Regulatory Compliance and Consumer Trust**: Implementing GS1 standards aids
   in meeting various regulatory requirements across countries and industries.
   This compliance helps in building consumer trust, as the systems enable
   transparent verification of supply chain practices, improving the reputation
   of businesses utilizing the Cardano blockchain.

### Challenges

1. **Technical and Operational Integration**: The integration of complex
   standards like those of GS1 into existing systems poses significant technical
   challenges. Ensuring that the Cardano blockchain can effectively communicate
   and operate with these standards without errors or inconsistencies will
   require substantial development effort and expertise.
2. **Adoption by Stakeholders**: For the full benefits of GS1 standards
   integration to be realized, widespread adoption by all stakeholders in the
   supply chain is necessary. Convincing stakeholders to adopt new technologies
   and adapt to a blockchain-based system might be challenging due to varying
   levels of technology acceptance and readiness.

## Rationale for Integration

### Why GS1?

* **Neutral and Non-Profit**: GS1 is a neutral, not-for-profit international
  organization dedicated to developing and maintaining supply chain standards.
* **Global Reach and Influence**: It has over 116 member organizations and
  influences over 2 million companies across 25 diverse industries worldwide,
  facilitating operations in 150 countries.
* **Barcode Recognition**: GS1 barcodes are universally recognized, with more
  than 1 billion products utilizing these barcodes, which are scanned more than
  10 billion times each day.
* **Partnership with ISO**: GS1 collaborates with the International Organization
  for Standardization (ISO) to contribute to the creation of globally recognized
  standards, enhancing interoperability and consistency across international
  borders.

The strategic integration of GS1 standards into the Cardano blockchain is guided
by several critical factors:

### Global Recognition and Adoption

By choosing standards that are widely recognized and adopted globally, we ensure
that applications developed on the Cardano blockchain are compatible with
existing supply chain systems worldwide. This compatibility is essential for
seamless interaction and integration with global supply chain operations, from
agricultural traceability to retail and consumer goods management.

### Increased Traceability and Efficiency

GS1 standards like GTIN and GTS provide robust standards for traceability and
efficiency. For agricultural products, this means being able to track the
journey of products from farm to table, ensuring safety and compliance at every
step. In transportation and logistics, the use of GLN and TDS enables more
efficient and transparent processes, improving logistics operations and delivery
accuracy.

### Regulatory Compliance and Consumer Trust

Implementing these standards not only supports compliance with various
regulatory requirements but also builds consumer trust by enabling transparent
and verifiable supply chain practices. In retail environments, the use of GIAI
for asset management ensures that consumer goods meet the highest standards of
quality and safety.

## Closing Thoughts

The integration of GS1 standards into the Cardano blockchain allows for a
proactive and future-oriented approach. Adopting these globally recognized
standards lays a robust foundation that not only supports the current
development of powerful applications but also ensures their continued relevance
and interoperability within the global supply chain ecosystem.

This alignment with GS1 standards promises to elevate the Cardano blockchain's
capabilities in key areas:

* **Traceability for Agricultural Products**: Utilizing standards such as the
  Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), we enhance the traceability of agricultural
  products throughout the supply chain. This enables a more transparent path
  from farm to table, ensuring safety, compliance, and reliability in the
  agricultural sector.

* **Transportation and Logistics Standards**: With the integration of the Global
  Location Number (GLN), our initiatives improve the identification of physical
  locations and legal entities, which is essential for optimizing logistics
  operations. This leads to more streamlined transportation processes and
  enhances the efficiency and transparency of supply networks.

* **Retail and Consumer Goods Standards**: The adoption of the Global Individual
  Asset Identifier (GIAI) and other relevant GS1 standards facilitates better
  asset management and product tracking in retail environments. This improvement
